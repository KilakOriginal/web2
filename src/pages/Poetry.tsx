            <p className="mb-6">
                My frame upon this stony beach<br />
                Where blades of oceanic steel<br />
                Cut deep into my tender flesh<br />
                Releasing streams of crimson nectar<br />
                To sate their fickle mistress' hunger<br /><br />

                Her winged heralds—grey and white<br />
                Circle me all day, all night<br />
                A choir of doom, wheeling, crying<br />
                They bid me drop my guard and yield<br />
                To her o' so cold embrace<br /><br />

                Now her hoary glacial voice<br />
                Creeps into each sacred thought<br />
                And with the anguish of her suitors<br />
                Sacrificed in centuries past<br />
                My mind is twisted—torn apart<br /><br />

                As my vision starts to fade<br />
                My chest weighed down with gloom and grief<br /> 
                A fleeting heartbeat—then release!<br />
                A white dove from the clouds emerging<br />
                Sings me to eternal peace
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-3xl mb-4" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Lullaby</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
                I stand upon an icy crest<br />
                The tempest will not let me rest<br />
                My heart was frozen long ago<br />
                Its fragile glow snuffed out by snow<br /><br />

                I lie here in this small dark room<br />
                Seeking shelter in a warm cocoon<br />
                The drizzling rain my only song<br />
                Mocking me all night long<br /><br />

                I challenge now the raging sea<br />
                Its wrathful waves consume me<br />
                Hurled upon this murky shore<br />
                My dreams, once bright, fade evermore<br /><br />

                In the middle of a stormy night<br />
                The whistling wind my lullaby<br />
                I hear a soft voice calling me<br />
                Are you the one who sets hearts free?<br /><br />

                I'm rambling in this field of gloom<br />
                The midnight air is rank perfume<br />
                Won't you take me by the hand<br />
                And lead me to the promised land?<br /><br />

                Blackness now envelops me<br />
                No melody, no sound I hear<br />
                Still I sense that you are near<br />
                Let me drown inside your glee!<br /><br />

                I come upon a waning lake<br />
                My withered heart begins to wake<br />
                I look into this mirror now<br />
                A stranger trapped behind the glass<br /><br />

                And is it me or is that you?<br />
                Oh stranger tell me—who are you?
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
                A fountain of starlight<br />
                In the cruel arctic sleet<br />
                Your heart blazes warmer<br />
                Than our sun's measly heat<br /><br />

                But no hearth will you be<br />
                To a pilgrim like me<br />
                For your trust has been broken<br />
                You deal with sorrow unspoken<br /><br />

                Many have stolen<br />
                Your embers so warm<br />
                Now they burn torrid<br />
                As to punish those reaching<br /><br />

                (Punish those reaching, reaching out for you<br />
                Punish those reaching, indiscriminately)<br /><br />

                All blue in the face<br />
                And shunned from your grace<br />
                I must stay and must watch<br />
                As your flame slowly fades
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
                Shall I call you aeroplane—<br />
                For you've taken me beyond the clouds<br />
                Past which life seems effortless<br />
                And my spirit may roam free<br /><br />

                Or perhaps you are an angel—<br />
                For such a face I've never seen<br />
                You chase away my direst troubles<br />
                Do it in the way you smile<br /><br />

                If not, a bird you must surely be—<br />
                Inspiring me with jauntiness<br />
                Singing in the sweetest voice<br />
                Of love, and peace, and happiness
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
                You used to wear<br />
                A daisy in your golden hair<br />
                And your white dress<br />
                Whispered against the dew-kissed grass<br /><br />

                Sunlight caught the glint<br />
                In your eyes, they shone like the stars<br />
                Oh, sister of the sun<br />
                Where have you gone?<br /><br />

                A white dove used to sing<br />
                On your balcony in the spring<br />
                Now a raven with onyx eyes<br />
                Sits perched above your door<br /><br />

                I see shadows dancing on the wall<br />
                Sitting on this floor,<br />
                Where our laughter would ring all night long<br />
                Have you followed the setting sun?<br /><br />

                You used to give<br />
                Me a daisy each time we'd meet<br />
                I've kept them all, but now they're gone<br />
                Just ghosts between the pages of time
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-3xl mb-4" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Farewell to Jabril</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
                In the heart of the whispering woods,<br />
                Where lost souls found their way,<br />
                He mended our shattered hearts<br />
                With his grace and kind words and his beam.<br />
                We found solace and warmth and peace.<br /><br />

                Then when fire claimed the land,<br />
                And villages turned into fine grey sand,<br />
                In the inferno's cruel embrace,<br />
                Your stone cold body lay.<br />
                Yes, your tender frame disgraced.<br /><br />

                Through thick black smoke, your face appears,<br />
                A ghost of wisdom in the flame,<br />
                I sing your name<br />
                In the twilight's soothing hush,<br />
                In echoes born of pain.<br /><br />

                Oh, Jabril, in your garden of lost grace,<br />
                Your gentle spirit lingers still—<br />
                Like a song unsung,<br />
                Amid the weeping trees.<br />
                Where sorrowed doves cry on.<br /><br />

                Who stole your light beneath that burning sky?<br />
                Keeper of this sacred grove,<br />
                Now left to grow on wild—<br />
                Yet in each fallen petal,<br />
                I hear your voice resound.<br /><br />

                Jabril, your name a solemn verse,<br />
                Etched forever in our grieving hearts.<br />
                And when the world has lost its way,<br />
                I'll sing your ballad every day.<br /><br />

                (Fare thee well, Jabril<br />
                Fare thee well, Jabril)<br /><br />

                And in every shadowed hour,<br />
                Your memory lives on.

            <p className="mb-6">
                I've always had this dream<br />
                To fly as to be free<br />
                But then I found, that a leaf blown on the wind<br />
                Is no more than a rambler on a freight train<br /><br />

                I've always wanted to be<br />
                Driving down the highway to feel free<br />
                But then I found, that a passenger on the bus<br />
                Can only ever look out of the window<br /><br />

                I've always wished be<br />
                Sailing on the open sea<br />
                But then I found, that a traveler on a raft<br />
                Can never ever fight the ocean's current<br /><br />

                I wish that I could spread my wings<br />
                Like the eagle or a vulture<br />
                I guess I'll have to learn<br />
                That my own two legs can walk me down any path that I would like to
